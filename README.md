# Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

**Project Description**
This project focuses on analyzing and evaluating two distinct datasets: job data and user/email engagement data. The primary objective is to derive meaningful insights and key metrics through data analysis, aiming to assess the performance and growth of various aspects within the datasets.
For the job data set, the analysis will encompass calculating the daily rate of jobs reviewed per hour for November 2020, determining a 7-day rolling average of throughput, examining the language distribution percentage, and identifying duplicate entries.
Simultaneously, the user engagement and email engagement datasets will be explored to uncover insights related to weekly user engagement, user growth, weekly retention rates for the user sign-up cohort, device-specific engagement on a weekly basis, and metrics pertaining to email engagement. SQL will serve as the primary tool for conducting these analyses.

**Appproach**
Identify the required tables: Determine the specific tables that contain the data needed for the query.
Join relevant tables: Perform table joins by linking tables that either hold the data to be displayed or are used in the WHERE clause of the query. The join conditions should establish proper relationships between the tables.
Display all data for verification: Retrieve and display the relevant data from the joined tables to confirm that the join operations have been executed correctly. 

**Tech-Stack Used**
